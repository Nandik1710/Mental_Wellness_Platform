# 🧠 Mental Wellness Support Platform (Prototype)

A web-based **Mental Wellness Support Platform** designed to help users reflect on their emotions, access wellness resources, and connect through a prototype telehealth-style session system.

This project demonstrates how digital tools can support mental well-being using journaling, AI assistance, and simulated remote consultation features.

⚠️ This is a **prototype application** built for learning and demonstration purposes. It is not a medical or diagnostic system.

## 🎯 Project Objective

To design a digital platform that combines:

- Emotional self-reflection tools  
- Wellness tracking concepts  
- Remote counselor interaction workflows  
- AI-assisted mental wellness guidance  

---

## 🧩 Core Features

### 📓 Personal Journal (Client-Side Storage)
- Users can write and save journal entries  
- Entries are stored locally in the browser  
- Encourages emotional reflection and self-awareness  

---

### 💓 Wellness Tracking Concept (Future Scope)
- Designed to integrate wearable data such as **sleep patterns** and **heart rate**
- Intended to analyze how physical health may correlate with emotional well-being  
- Currently implemented as a **UI/UX concept** without live device data  

---

### 🎥 Video Session with Therapist (Prototype)

A **prototype remote session system** built to simulate online mental health consultations.

**How it works:**
- A session link can be generated and shared  
- Opening the link on another browser/device allows both sides to connect  
- Demonstrates how digital therapy or counseling sessions could be structured  

**Backend Prototype:**  
Implemented using **Python** to handle the session connection logic and simulate real-time communication workflows.

This feature focuses on understanding **telehealth system design**, not production-ready deployment.

### 🤖 AI Wellness Support Chatbot (Gemini API)
- Integrated Gemini API for conversational interaction  
- Provides general coping suggestions, stress management tips, and wellness guidance  
- Designed as **supportive AI assistance**, not a replacement for professional care  

---

### 🧘 Guided Wellness Resources
- Sections for meditation and breathing exercises  
- Encourages stress reduction and mindfulness habits
